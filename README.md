# Categorical Perception
This project aims to build and understand categorical perception models that attempt to systemize visual categorization in humans. In understanding the world around us, visual categorization is one of the important tasks we learn to do. In many experiments, researchers have found that subjects learn to categorize objects despite very nonobvious differences.

Throughout this project, I attempt to understand the different models described in literature and model them using MATLAB. I then compare these mathematical models to subject performance to discern how categorization works for humans.

Two major models are:
* [The prototype model](prototype.md)
* The exemplar model
